            This is cinematography in its raw form with practical lamps, soft
            falloff, and the presence of grain that fills each corner of the
            frame. Every room functions as a set and every posture becomes a
            composition. Light moves across furniture and faces, shaping scenes
            with a natural sense of depth.

            the camera settles into long takes and patient movement. Colors stay
            unrefined and shadows turn into texture. The image waits for action
            instead of chasing it. Every frame forms a clear visual language
            built through restraint.
